What is Label Studio?
Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool
that supports multiple projects, users and data types in one platform.

It allows you to do the following:

- Perform different types of labeling with many data formats.
- Integrate Label Studio with machine learning models to
  supply predictions for labels (pre-labels), or perform continuous
  active learning.
